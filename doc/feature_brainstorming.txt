Features that we want, in no particular order:

- null should be an instance of Object, but special in that it can be assigned
  to a variable of any type. This means it should be legal to call all of
  Object's methods on null. Any other method would cause a
  NullPointerException.

- The constructior method would be a normal method. Right now, we'll call it
  'init'. Constructors will be inherited.

- super() should be able to be called at any point in a constructor.

- Default accessibility of methods should be public, and member variables
  should be private.

- Members (variables and methods) must always be qualified with the Object they
  are a member of. (eg. Even inside the object, you must say this.var or
  this.method())

- Types should be optional where it is unambiguous.

- Inner classes should be proper closures. (No "can only see final variables")

- Make inner classes less verbose and easier to use.

- No checked exceptions.

- Ability to catch more than one type of exception in a catch statement.

- Have obj.attr automaticaly call obj.getAttr(), if that doesn't exist, fall
  back to attempting to access obj.attr directly.

- Have obj.attr = 1 automatically call obj.setAttr(1), if that doesn't exist,
  fall back to attempting to access obj.attr directly.

- Syntax to list the member variables of a class that should have getters
  and/or setters automatically generated.
